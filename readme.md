# An End-to-End Machine Learning Project: Analysing Forex Currency Trends

!! Code based on tutorial by : @furkhan67 !!

This project is an introduction to industry-style machine learning. 
- DatasetðŸ“‘: "Foreign_Exchange_Rates.xls" Sample of 2000-2019 forex data

- analysis.ipynbðŸ“¢: Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, 
                    completed preprocessing, 
                    evaluated the performance of 3 *time series models* (Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM),
                    trained models on individual currencies,
                    and used *joblib* to save the best models.

- app.pyðŸŽ†: Web app setup using *Streamlit* 

- Dockerfile: For production-ready packaging


Note: Run the streamlit app using `streamlit run app\app.py`
